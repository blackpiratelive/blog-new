If you have visited my this blog before,(and can remember it) you can clearly see the difference. This blog is now simpler. I like it. Hope you  like it too. As I am going to get busy with my life, I hope I would stick with this theme for very long.  

### How this website is made
I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for creating this website. Hugo is  great. I am loving it. Earlier also I was using Hugo, but that time I didn't know much about it, so I used a ready made theme for my website. This time the theme is mine. That is why it is so minimal. This theme uses only HTML and little bit of CSS, I would tweak as time goes on.  The inspiration came from [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz), in this [video](https://youtu.be/ZFL09qhKi5I/) he explained things about hugo, which has helped me a lot. So I made this. I knew that I was going to make my own theme someday, beacuse I do not like those available. 

After I learn more about creating hugo themes, or actually how to use hugo, I shall also make new theme for my [gallery](https://gallery.blackpiratex.com) website. It looks good, but it is slow. I would try to make it javascript free. Right now it uses so much javascript which makes it slow. I know that Hugo can compress images so I need to figure those things out before I move my gallery website to custom made theme. 

### Suggestions 
I would definitely love to get some feedback about how to improve my website. You can send me email at comments@blackpiratex.com regarding this. If you think everything is right, give me few opinions about these - 
- Shall I add comments using github issues? 
- Dark mode? 
- Search?

Thank you.
